        Born in Missouri and lived in California, I started my childhood with a move. Currently, as a middle child and typical Asian-American
        kid, I get done with my schoolwork and start coding or wandering on YouTube. Math is one of my strong subjects and play basketball in
        my free time. On Sundays, I go to church and enjoy learning about God without a stereotypical boring sermon  (because my church is cool like that).
        Every once in a while, I play some video games with friends.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As a "teen", I have decided to design a simple website for fun. As I continue to do so, it provokes me
          to become a full stack web developer in my future years. With the constant advent of newer technology, I believe that soon almost all of things we do in
          America will be based on technology. Sadly, not everywhere has the oppurtunity God has given me. And I take the responsibilty to reach everybody in the
           world and allow them to have a taste of technology.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        My goals, however, require perserverance after the various obstacles I encounter. I believe that in order to succeed, you must overcome.
        However, to overcome you must have determination; and when you do not what like what you are doing, you will never have the true determination.
        So, when you are looking for something to do with your life, do not simply set out to just become a doctor or a lawyer because they have a good pay.
        Do something you like to do. And after all, if you love what you do you will become a master because the only way to become a master is to love what you do.
        When you become a master, you will be paid a good fee. So the question is, "What do you want to be?"
