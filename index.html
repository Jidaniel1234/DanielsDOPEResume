      <p>
        Born in Missouri and lived in California, I started my childhood with a move. Currently, as a middle child and typical Asian-American
        kid, I get done with my schoolwork and start coding or wandering on YouTube. Math is one of my strong subjects and play basketball in
        my free time. On Sundays, I go to church and enjoy learning about God without a stereotypical boring sermon  (because my church is cool like that).
        Every once in a while, I play some video games with friends.

          Over the last couple years I have probably been more productive than the rest of my life.
          Beginning in 4th grade, I was invited by my school to represent our team in the MathCount's field day event in our region, recieving a 3rd place
          and having a memorable time. Also, I began basketball in my city's team. Starting in 5th grade, I started enrolling into after school math classes, and learned Algebra that year.
          Continuing on into 6th grade, I entered the MathCounts team there to but unable to compete since there were 8th graders that were
          much more experienced than me. In 7th grade, I started to learn how to code, learning some HTML and CSS as well as rejoin the team and compete in
          regionals, recieving a 3rd place again. Additionally, our school's Science Olympiad was interesting and decided to join that as well. So here
          I am now, in 8th grade, creating my first functional (made others before but were pretty cringy) website, in Science Olympiad and MathCounts again,
          and taking Pre-Calculus.
